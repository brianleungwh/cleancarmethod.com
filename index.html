                                    <p>Let’s face it, buying a new car is possibly one of the worst financial decision you can make. Not only do you have to pay all kinds of BS dealer fees, new cars depreciate at a rate that’s just unfair. Unless you have a lot of cash to spare or you anticipate the car you plan on purchasing to be a future classic and plan on holding it for 15 or more years, there is little to no reason to buy a new car in this day and age.</p>

                                    <p>Truth is, many people in the market for a car know this and they still decide to bear the unreasonable cost to buy a new car to avoid having to spend the time to do the necessary research or deal with the “hassle” of buying a used car. This is totally understandable. You do a quick Google Search on “how to buy a used car” and you get a sea of articles that tells you more or less the same thing. While I’d have to admit, most of these articles provide some good general advice but they just are't very straightfoward to apply. You are told to take the car to the mechanic because you were told that you aren’t good enough to inspect the car yourself. Not only will taking the car you are interested in buying to the mechanic cost you and the seller more hassle and time, the shop you decide to take the car to can easily charge you over a hundred dollars for inspection fee. If you already know a little bit about how a car works, then I am here to tell you that you ARE good enough to inspect the car of your interest. There is no reason to go back-and-forth with the seller multiple times, and absolutely no reason to take the car to a shop just so you can get a piece of paper with a bunch of checkboxes that tells you things that you can find out yourself. At the end of the day, it is going to be your car so don’t be afraid to own that responsibility! And I guarantee it, it's not as daunting as you might think. You’d feel accomplished and confident driving your “new” car home because you had saved yourself a lot of time and money in the deal!</p>

                                    <p>I am a car enthusiast who likes to switch cars more often than most other people and so I have bought and sold a good number of cars and motorcycles over the past 7 years. I have made mistakes in the beginning and bought cars in a not-so-good condition that gave me all kinds of trouble. I have since dedicated the time to learn more about cars itself and the used car buying process. Eventually I got good at it and have since been buying and selling only cars in clean/immaculate condition. I am now putting together this knowledge and experience into a package that is designed to be straightforward so that it saves you both time and money, all at a fraction of the cost of what a shop would charge you to do a “full” inspection!</p>
